A gatsby plugin for static i18n.

In particular, this plugin create a copy of every page for each locale, and passes to each page the current locale
(among other info) as `pageContext`.
It also includes a wrapped `Link` component that supports i18n and a `LocalesInfoProvider` that you can use to provide
the locale info as context.

## Installation

With npm:

```sh
npm i gatsby-plugin-i18nstatic
```

With yarn:

```sh
yarn add gatsby-plugin-i18nstatic
```

## Usage

### Plugin

Add the following section to your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
{
  resolve: "gatsby-plugin-i18nstatic",
    options: {
      locales: ["en", "es"],
      defaultLocale: "en"
  }
}
```

where the `locales` option is a list of all the locales you want to generates pages for, and `defaultLocale`
is the locale to associate with the root (`/`) path of your app.

For example, say that we have a page called `home`. In this case the plugin would generate a page with the path
`/home` with the english locale, and a page at `/es/home` with the spanish locale.

Of course, `defaultLocale` is optional: if you don't want this behaviour, simply omit it.

An alternative to specifing the locales as an array is to instead use the `localesFolder` option (and if needed, also the
`ignoredFolders` one), like this:

```js
{
  resolve: "gatsby-plugin-i18nstatic",
    options: {
      localesFolder: `${__dirname}/src/locales`,
      ignoredFolders: ["_build"],
      defaultLocale: "en"
  }
}
```

This way, the plugin will consider every directory in the folder `${__dirname}/src/locales` as a locale, while
also obviously ignoring the ones specified in `ignoredFolders`.

### Components

This plugin also included a couple of useful React components:

- `Link`: a lighweight wrapper around Gatsby's Link component, with support for localized routes.
